# AI4UAV-code
This project is a code simulator designed to provide a realistic and interactive environment for practicing and experimenting with python. The algorithms were initially integrated, using a simulation that control, navigate and run the drone in PX4 version 1.13.1 and MAVSDK software with Python mavsdk library in the Loop (SITL) simulation. Gazebo 11 simulator interface helped us to preview the mission of the UAV.
